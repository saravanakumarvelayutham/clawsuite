# ClawSuite Roadmap

## Current: Agent Hub Completion (Feb 22-23, 2026)
- [x] 3-tab restructure (Overview/Configure/Missions)
- [x] Pixel robot avatars + avatar picker
- [x] Enterprise light theme polish
- [x] Agent output slide-out panel with markdown rendering
- [x] Mission bug fixes (timeline, streaming, status counts, navigation)
- [x] Component extraction (6 sub-components)
- [x] Auth guards on all write APIs
- [ ] Mission deliverables/artifacts system
- [ ] Mission reports with auto-summary
- [ ] Final QA pass + push to GitHub

## Phase 1 — Close Competitive Gaps (Next Sprint)
- [ ] 🔐 Authentication (password gate + session tokens, later MFA)
- [ ] 📊 Cron management UI (API exists, needs frontend)
- [ ] 🔍 Memory browser UI (API exists, needs frontend)
- [ ] 📋 Mission artifacts — file attachments, inline preview, download links
- [ ] 📄 Auto-generated mission reports (goal, agents, outputs, cost)
- [ ] 🎨 Theme system (ops-dark, premium-dark, paper-light)

## Phase 2 — Differentiation
- [ ] 🔄 Flow visualization (animated agent message flow, inspired by ClawMetry)
- [ ] 📁 File browser/editor (workspace file management)
- [ ] 💰 Cost analytics with trends, charts, per-model breakdown
- [ ] 🏗️ Server-side mission orchestrator (persist configs, real task queue)
- [ ] 🔔 Webhooks/notifications (Slack/Discord alerts on mission complete)
- [ ] 👥 Multi-user support (roles, team sharing)

## Phase 3 — Scale
- [ ] Agent tools/capabilities (assign browser, code exec, etc. per agent)
- [ ] Guardrails enforcement (spending limits, approval gates, server-enforced)
- [ ] Fine-tuning pipeline integration
- [ ] Plugin marketplace (community agent templates)
- [ ] Public cloud deployment option

## Competitive Position (Feb 2026)
**We're the only full-suite option** (chat + agents + terminal + browser).
Gaps vs competitors: auth, cron UI, memory browser, cost charts.
Unique advantages: agent orchestration, multi-model switching, voice input, integrated terminal.
