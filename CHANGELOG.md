## [3.0.0] — 2026-02-25 (feat/clean-sprint)

### 🚀 New Features

#### Agent Hub
- **Mission dispatch fix (BUG-1)**: Wired agent dispatch to `/api/agent-dispatch` (gateway RPC lane: subagent) — was incorrectly calling `sessions/send` (chat) causing missions to not actually run
- **Exec approval modal (BUG-3)**: Full SSE-driven approval UI — stacked queue, 30s countdown timer, risk badges, auto-deny on timeout, approve/deny with loading states
- **Pause/steer fix**: Pause now sends real steer signal via `chat.send` fallback — was no-op before
- **Live output panel**: Redesigned with compact agent info, colored status badges, better progress bar
- **Overview restored**: Office view fills full height with internal stats row, secondary widgets below

#### Dashboard
- **Cost tracking analytics (BUG-2)**: Full `/costs` page with real SQLite data — hero KPIs (MTD, projected EOM, budget %), per-agent breakdown, daily trend chart (30 days), per-model usage table
- **Dashboard revamp B/C/D (FEAT-6)**: Full dark mode consistency across all surfaces, hardcoded `localhost:3000` WebSocket origin replaced with dynamic derivation, widget edit controls moved out of header

#### New Screens
- **Memory Browser (FEAT-2)**: View, search, and edit `MEMORY.md` + `memory/*.md` in-app — grouped file list, full-text search with line jump, edit mode, unsaved changes indicator, markdown preview toggle
- **Workspace File Browser (FEAT-3)**: Split-panel file tree navigator — expandable folders, file icons by type, markdown preview, syntax highlighting for TS/JS/JSON, image preview, edit + save
- **Cost Analytics page**: `/costs` route with real usage data, per-agent and per-model breakdowns

#### Settings & Infrastructure
- **Provider restart UX (FEAT-4)**: Adding/removing a provider now shows confirm dialog → full-screen gateway restart overlay → health polling → auto-dismiss on recovery. 30s timeout with manual retry.
- **System metrics footer (FEAT-1)**: Persistent CPU/RAM/disk/gateway/uptime bar — **off by default**, toggle in Settings
- **Session status fix (FEAT-7)**: `/api/sessions/:key/status` now does real `sessions.list` gateway lookup with proper 404/401/500 handling — was hardcoded `active` before

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Mission crash fix**: Restored `sessions.send→chat.send` fallback in agent-dispatch preventing no-output on mission launch
- **Chat dedup (BUG-4)**: Fixed duplicate messages on paste/attach
- **Mission pause state (BUG-5)**: Fixed pause state not syncing across components
- **Mobile nav glass effect**: Fixed `isolate` CSS property breaking `backdrop-filter` in Safari/WebKit — frosted glass nav now works correctly
- **Mobile safe area**: Chat input properly clears tab bar with `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` padding
- **Dashboard WebSocket origin**: Removed hardcoded `localhost:3000` — now derives origin from gateway URL dynamically

### 🔒 Security
- **SEC-1**: Auth guards added to 10 previously unprotected API routes
- **SEC-2**: Wildcard CORS removed from browser-proxy + browser-stream
- **SEC-3**: Full audit pass:
  - Auth guards on terminal, browser, debug-analyze, config-get, paths, context-usage endpoints
  - Rate limiting on high-risk endpoints: exec, gateway-restart, update-check (npm install → RCE risk)
  - `requireJsonContentType()` CSRF guard on all mutating POST routes
  - Input validation on body parameters
  - Skills `GET /api/skills` was unauthenticated — fixed
  - `SECURITY.md` updated with full audit summary

### 📱 Mobile
- **MOB-1**: Nav glass effect (Safari `isolate` fix)
- **MOB-2**: Agent Hub shows agent card grid on mobile (office hidden `< 640px`)
- **MOB-3**: Bottom nav frosted glass — `backdrop-blur-xl` direct application
- **MOB-4**: Chat input safe-area insets, clears tab bar
- **MOB-5**: Dashboard quick actions replaced with 2×2 widget card grid
- **MOB-6**: Agent Hub bottom nav icon swapped to `BotIcon`
- **MOB-7**: Glass effects on mobile overlays

### 🔍 QA Sweep (FEAT-5)
All tool tabs verified and fixed:
- **Browser tab**: Fully wired via gateway RPC ✅
- **Terminal tab**: PTY streaming (SSE) confirmed working ✅
- **Cron tab**: `nextRunAt` type field added, all CRUD verified ✅
- **File Manager**: All operations working, auth guards confirmed ✅
- **Skills tab**: Added missing auth guard on `GET /api/skills` ✅

### 🏗️ Agent Hub Style
- All headers, cards, containers now match dashboard style exactly: `rounded-xl border border-primary-200 bg-primary-50/95 shadow-sm`
- Page background unified: `bg-primary-100/45`
- Office view crop fixed — `overflow-hidden` removed, SVG fills container
